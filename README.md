# Part III Mathematics Essay - LaTeX Document

## Introduction and Background  

This dissertation was my submission for my degree, Part III Masters in Applied Mathematics at the University of Cambridge. I obtained a distinction-level dissertation with 87%. It is also the same template I used for my undergraduate dissertation where I obtained 91% and subsequently the highest-graded dissertation in my year.

For advice on writing a dissertation, I have a video where I give my tips and tricks. You can find it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJfLMVkbonc)!

Happy dissertation-ing!

## The Contents 

This resource has a text file (to be used in LaTeX), the final PDF document as well as the images used within my dissertation. This resource is designed so that you can copy the same template for your own dissertation and make amendments where necessary.

## Changing the Template for Your Own Dissertation

If you wish to change the template provided in this dissertation, you can do so by amending the text file. This file is compiled into a PDF format that can be found in this resource too. When you make changes to the text file and recompile, this will make the corresponding changes to the PDF file too. 

Within the text file, I have added comments where appropriate so that you can understand the source code and adjust where necessary. I find it easiest to have the text file and PDF side-by-side so that you can follow where the code matches up with the PDF (most LaTeX software already does this).

## Using LaTeX

To amend the text file, you will need a version of LaTeX. If you want LaTeX on your laptop, you can install it [here](https://www.latex-project.org/get/) and download the appropriate TeX distribution according to your operating system. If you’d prefer an online version, you can use [OverLeaf](https://www.overleaf.com). Once you have either OverLeaf or a version of LaTex installed on your laptop, you can open this repository in either of them. 

If you are using a software on your laptop, like TeXShop, you must first open the text file in TeXShop. Then, all you need to do is click ‘Typeset’ and this will typeset the current version of your text-file into a PDF with the same title as your text file. Then you’re ready to go!

If you are using an online resource like OverLeaf, click 'New Project' then click 'Upload Project' and upload this repository. Alternatively, you can create a blank project, copy and paste the contents inside the text file into the blank text file and upload the images separately. Then, all you need to do is compile the text file and this will typeset the current version of your text-file into a PDF with the same title as your text file. Then you’re ready to go!
